# Myeline

Intramedullary spinal cord tumors are rare but detrimental lesions that form within the spinal cord. Surgical access to these tumors requires incision into the nervous tissue of the spinal cord. If this incision is placed through the active nervous tissue of the dorsal columns, the patient can suffer sensory detriments following the procedure, including pain, loss of sensation in the extremities, and difficulty coordinating motions such as walking. To avoid these detriments, the surgeon aims to incise the spinal cord along the midline, a thin strip of physiologically inert tissue. Spinal cord tumors often distort the spinal cord anatomy, so typical anatomical indicators of the midline fail, and the surgeon needs a more robust method for locating the midline. Myeline provides a device that may someday enable surgeons to quickly and accurately locate the inert midline using electrical stimulation and recording of evoked action potentials in the spine.
